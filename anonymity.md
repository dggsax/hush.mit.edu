## How do I know that my posts are anonymous?

Hush doesn't require you to login to post, the only way hush checks that you're part of the MIT Community is by verifying that your request is coming from an IP owned by MIT. Your identifying information never leaves your computer. Hush rate limits by using captchas on frequent posts by the same IP addresses.
